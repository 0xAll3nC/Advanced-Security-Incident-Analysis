# Advanced Security Incident Analysis

## Overview  
Email is one of the primary attack vectors used by hackers to extract sensitive information. This analysis explores how phishing emails manipulate email headers, embedded content, and attachments to trick users into revealing personal or corporate information.

## Email Header Analysis  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Delivered To  
Indicates the recipient of the email.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Received  
- Just like a postal system, emails go through multiple mail servers before reaching the recipient.  
- The topmost "Received" header shows the closest mail server to the recipient.  
- To analyze sender authenticity, we scroll to the **"Received: by"** field closest to the sender.

## Authentication Checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  

### SPF Failure Detection  
spf=fail (google.com: domain of billjobs@microapple.com does not designate 93.99.104.210 as permitted sender)

yaml
Copy
This means the domain @microapple.com does not authorize 93.99.104.210, making this highly suspicious.  

If SPF fails, it is recommended to:  
- Inspect the authentication-results header for further verification.  
- Cross-check if the Reply-To field is different from the From field, which is another red flag.

## Analyzing Suspicious Fields  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Reply-To Mismatch  
- **From:** billjobs@microapple.com  
- **Reply-To:** negeja3921@pashter.com  
- Since the **Reply-To field differs from the From field**, this is an indication of a phishing attempt.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Content-Type Analysis  
- The email specifies **multipart/mixed**, meaning multiple formats exist.  
- The first boundary contains **encoded text (Base64)**, which we need to decode.

## Decoding Base64 Content  

### Step 1: Decode Email Body  
We extracted and decoded the first **Base64-encoded content** to reveal the phishing message.

### Step 2: Decode Attachment  
The email contained an attachment **PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf**, encoded in Base64.  
We decoded it, but the content was unreadable.

## File Type Analysis: Is the Attachment Really a PDF?  
Upon further inspection, the extracted file signature did **not** match a PDF.  
We converted the content into **hex format** for further analysis.

Using **Gary Kessler‚Äôs File Signature Database**, we determined that:  
- The file starts as a **ZIP archive** but was disguised as a **PDF**.

## Extracting ZIP Content  
We manually saved the file as **.zip** and extracted the contents.  
Inside, we found:  

1. **DaughtersCrown.jpeg**  
2. **GoodJobMajor.pdf**  
3. **A hidden .xlsx file (Money.xlsx)**

---


## Hex Analysis of Hidden Files  
We inspected **DaughtersCrown.jpeg** in HxD and verified it was a **valid JPEG**.

Similarly, **GoodJobMajor.pdf** was verified using the **PDF file signature**.

## Hidden Data in Money.xlsx  
Inside **Money.xlsx**, we discovered a third hidden sheet (**Sheet3**) that contained **Base64-encoded text**.  
[![View Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_Image-Click_Here-blue?style=for-the-badge)](images/email_analysis_money_xlsx_sheet3.png)  

After decoding, it revealed a **location**:  
**The Martian Colony, Beside Interplanetary Spaceport.**

## Final Analysis & Key Findings  
- The **SPF failed**, and **Reply-To was different from From**, indicating a forged sender.  
- The **attached "PDF" was actually a ZIP file**, containing **hidden malicious files**.  
- The **hidden Excel sheet** contained **Base64-encoded location information**.  
- **Conclusion:** This was an **advanced phishing attack** attempting to hide clues within **disguised attachments**.
